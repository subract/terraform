# Terraform

This repo stores the Terraform configuration form `subract`'s homelab. I created it around the time I was beginning to deploy services to a VPS provider (Hetzner).

It contains two [deployments](deployments):

- **[prod](deployments/prod)**: Contains the production instance of my web servers
- **[games](deployments/games)**: Contains a game server that can be run on-demand
